  * Things to learn
    * Either VHDL or Verilog.
    * FPGA's (useful area to play with writing digital logic).
    * Basic data-path stuff, like FIFO's.
    * Bus interfaces, like PCIe and DDR2/3 interfacing
    * Binary implementations of math functions, including floating point, etc.
    * CPU design.
    * Video interfacing standards.
    * High speed analog stuff (the analog side of high speed digital)
    * PLL's and other semi-advanced clocking stuff.
    * PCB design of high speed circuits.
    * Low voltage, high current DC/DC converter design.
    * Lots and lots of software stuff.
    * And finally, ASIC or other custom chip type design.
